Hyperland
=========

Hyperland is a geometrically accurate simulation platform that gives users first-person access to movement and perception in four-dimensional space.

Thanks to previous generations of innovators, we can see glimpses of the fruits of spatial manifolds with four dimensions; projections of 4D objects into 3D space are increasingly common. However, we have yet to bear witness to a user orienting, moving, and interacting in a space with other users where they have audiovisual and haptic feedback regarding conditions across eight cardinal directions instead of just six. 

Broadly speaking, the two-stage plan is to develop a simulation of:

1. 4D Euclidean space as proof-of-concept
2. Minkowski spacetime with four spatial dimensions to include relativistic effects
